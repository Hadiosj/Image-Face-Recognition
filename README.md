# Image-Face-Recognition
This project uses the face_recognition library, which is used to recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line.

There are two code files: 

"identify.py" uses a photo provided from the directory, detect the faces in this photo and try to recognize them using the images in the "Arsenal Players" folder.

"Webcam.py" detect faces from the webcam using openCV and try to recognize them using images in the same directory as the code files (but no images are put in this repository).
